Description:

* In this project, I created a mining bot that automatically strip mines for you if you provide the bot with coal and some torches.
* The goal of this project was to program a functional turtle and have it work to automate a task.
* My project fits into the category of automatic mining.

--- 

Features:

* Automatically mines and places torches every few blocks.
* Automatic mining is convenient because you don't have to search for ores yourself; the strip mine is created for you.
* Automatically placing torches is useful and ensures that no monsters can spawn in the strip mine.
--- 

impact: 
* This mining bot could help other people by automatically mining for them. 
* You could start a mining bot army to mine a lot and quickly find ores and other things.

---

scope: 
* My mining turtle is focused on strip mining, not on searching for specific ores.
* I haven't added a function yet for it to mine exclusively for ores, so that doesn't work.
* This project took me about 2 days, with some other versions that didn't fully work.
